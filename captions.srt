2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,400
доброе утро всем, это Muhammad Ali

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,900
с новым видео и

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,120
в этом видео Я хочу поделиться с вами

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:18,000
как правильно настроить шасси

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,740
с момента как вы его получили

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,320
Я поробую сделать это настолько просто

8
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,820
насколько возможно, особенно для новичков

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,859
так же надеюсь это поможет с вашими

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,900
текущими настройками
так давайте начнем

11
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:30,359
многие знакомы с ситуацией когда

12
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,279
вы получили вашу новую шасси

13
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,440
которая, скорее всего, у вас первая

14
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,899
если вы конечно начинающий и вы

15
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,120
получаете тысячи кусочков, которые

16
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:42,360
собираете вместе и пытаетесь катать

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:46,140
первый раз и реальность догоняет вас

18
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:49,800
это далеко не то, что вы ожидали

19
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,420
будьте честны с собой, вы купили

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,760
шасси по видео с 

21
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,340
YouTube и Facebook, что, по моему

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,600
мнению, плохая идея

23
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,879
это фаза один

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,379
вторая фаза, Я называю ее

25
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:03,680
фазой скорби

26
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:06,900
в этот момент вы расстроены

27
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,580
Вы злитесь и жалеете, что потратили

28
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,780
200+ долларов на

29
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,580
ЭТОТ кусок мусора

30
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,799
и это вполне нормальная ситуация

31
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,900
все начинают примерно так же

32
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,880
есть кое-что, что вам нужно знать

33
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,860
для получения удовольствия от свое шасси

34
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,500
надо пройти много шагов 

35
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:25,680
о которых новички не знают

36
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,840
потому что в инструкции этого нету

37
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,960
и Я докажу это, поделившись своим опытом

38
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,780
и надеюсь это повысит

39
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:37,200
Вашу мотивацию продолжить с шасси

40
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:41,34
Я начал дрифтить

41
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,439
в сентябре 2019 года, моей первой шасси

42
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,560
была DRZ 1

43
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:50,220
и до этого Я участвовал в соревнованиях

44
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:53,700
багги в масштабах 1/8 и 1/10

45
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:57,240
электро и нитро и после этого Я

46
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,200
гонял на дронах почти 4 года

47
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,700
так что Я имею опыт

48
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,759
когда дело доходит

49
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:06,119
до сборки и тюнинга

50
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:09,000
когда Я получил DRZ, это была моя первая 

51
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:11,580
мини дрифт шасси

52
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,099
я собрал ее и когда попробовал 

53
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,260
впервый раз, я смотрелся как 

54
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:20,400
5ти летний пацан с пультом

55
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:22,020
серьёзно, так что это нормально, потому что

56
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,420
даже имея опыт сборки и

57
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:28,560
настойки, в этот момент

58
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:29,940
мой опыт сборки был

59
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,900
не терять сцепление с дорогой

60
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:36,540
в гонках, если вы скользите боком или 

61
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,520
теряете сцепление, вы теряете время

62
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,560
и если вы теряете время

63
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:45,660
вы проигрываете гонку

64
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:49,200
Я пересобирал мою DRZ 16 раз

65
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:51,900
ровно 16 раз, что бы она вела себя

66
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,700
как надо, потому что в голове

67
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,760
я все думал как

68
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:59,459
участвовать в гонках

69
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,860
и думал, что проблема в шасси, так что

70
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:04,260
Я посмотрел много видео и прочитал

71
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:07,379
много обзоров

72
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:12,360
и в конце Я собрал все части правильно

73
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:14,040
рычаги двигались свободно

74
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,680
без намека на люфт

75
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,260
как и должно быть и Я пробовал

76
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,400
каждый день и был прогресс

77
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,819
но не так быстро

78
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,400
или впечатляюще как я видел

79
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:30,000
на YouTube, так что я позвал своего приятеля

80
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,260
потому что я подумал,

81
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,659
может проблема не в машине,

82
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,700
а во мне

83
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:38,459
я повзонил приятелю и он

84
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:41,280
про дрифтер 1/10 масштаба, Я имею ввиду, что

85
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:43,440
он из тех, кто берет свою машину и

86
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,379
едет в аэропорт, что бы учавствовать в
соревнования в Японии

87
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,659
в дрифт эвентах в UK, так что я позвонил ему

88
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:51,120
и пригласил в гости

89
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:52,920
он понятия не имел, что его ожидает

90
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,780
Первое, что он спросил, это mini-z?

91
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,760
Я сказал ему нет, попробовал объяснить

92
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,459
что это DRZ. Он сказал ок

93
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:01,980
давай попробуем. Я дал ему передатчик. У него заняло

94
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:04,560
может быть 30 секунд он крутился на право

95
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:07,620
и на лево 48 секнуд и потом он пол минуты

96
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,780
держал угол

97
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,580
Я даже не думал

98
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:14,700
и не знал, что шасси

99
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:18,660
так может, так что он подтвердил 

100
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:20,340
мои опасения, что проблема не в 

101
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,180
шасси и вы должны всегда помнить

102
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:23,820
об этом

103
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,680
так что если вы начинающий Я ожидаю, что

104
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:28,380
Вы сталкнетесь с теме же проблемами
что и Я

105
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,139
с моими первыми пробами DRZ 1

106
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:34,440
Если вы конечно считаете

107
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:36,120
что дрифт это просто скользить туда-сюда

108
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,520
то у вас получится сразу

109
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,280
У меня получилось скользить

110
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:44,100
с первого раза, но

111
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:48,600
проблема была в том, что это было не так

112
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:50,639
ровно и плавно как я ожидал

113
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,100
Когда я держал пульт в первый раз

114
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,500
я вспоминал те ролики

115
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,419
и углы которые парни

116
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,300
держали и ту плавность с которой

117
00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:03,660
они управляли шасси, но

118
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:06,540
на тот момент я так не мог

119
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:09,060
или моя сборка была

120
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,199
достойна пяти летнего ребенка

121
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,720
на этом этапе, если бы у вас был

122
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:14,220
опыт в дрифте, вы бы

123
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,380
знали, что с вашей шасси не так

124
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,720
и исправили это без проблем

125
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,880
Но если вы начинающий

126
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,820
единственный путь продолжить после такой

127
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:27,060
ситуации, это понять концептуальные

128
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:29,940
основы дрифта, так что когда мы

129
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:33,600
говорим дрифт, идея состояит в потере

130
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:35,520
сцепления, но при этом мы сохраняем

131
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,919
полный контроль движения

132
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,900
так, если зад шасси закручивается

133
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,539
ваша рулевая

134
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:45,479
должна компенсировать

135
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:47,759
любой угол который вы держите

136
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:50,340
даже если это 90 градусов, это основной

137
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,380
концепт дрифта. Если у вас много газа и 

138
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,620
меньше выворота или 

139
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:57,060
наоборот, шасси сразу же закртит

140
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:59,940
Давайте начнем обсуждать как заставить

141
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:03,180
вашу шасси вести себя правильно и вот мои

142
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:05,340
три основных шага

143
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,740
которым вы должны следовать

144
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:11,460
первый шаг, сборка

145
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:13,380
потом настройки и навыки дрифта, если вы

146
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:16,080
собрали и настроили правильно 

147
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:19,020
ваш навык будет расти очень быстро

148
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:22,319
но если вы запутались в первых двух шагах

149
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:25,020
вы либо сдадитесь и 

150
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:28,199
возможно продадите шасси или 

151
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:30,000
вы не будете видеть прогресса

152
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:33,180
your skills so you have to follow the

153
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,600
steps so building that sounds simple

154
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:37,919
right you just download the instruction

155
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,139
manual

156
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,900
you read through it and you follow it

157
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:45,240
step by step which part goes where

158
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:47,400
and you're done with it this is not

159
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,259
necessary means you build your chassis

160
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:53,220
there's a big difference between a Lego

161
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:55,740
and an RC drift car for example

162
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,780
let's talk about this arm here

163
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,600
for example if not discount necessary

164
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:02,580
any car if the manual says put the arm

165
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,500
in this position and place two or three

166
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,940
shims up front for example if you don't

167
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,979
know what the shim is it's a small

168
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,960
plastic spacers that you have to place

169
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:12,300
to move the arm in a certain position

170
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:15,180
forward and back or backward to control

171
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:19,380
your Caster anyway for example let's say

172
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:21,479
the the manual set two two shims and you

173
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:25,039
place the two Shams and then your arm

174
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:25,039
acts like this see

175
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,280
this is bad this is too much play in the

176
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:35,460
arm and the reason for that even the

177
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:38,639
manual sit so because the the quality

178
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:42,960
control for this small plastic injection

179
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:44,300
mold part is not 100 accurate my arm

180
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:48,060
might be

181
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:51,479
0.05 thinner than your arm so in my case

182
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:54,300
I have to place one extra shim here to

183
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:57,060
control or to eliminate display while at

184
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:59,880
the same time maintaining full up and

185
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,319
low pre-motion so these things you have

186
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,639
to consider this is the difference

187
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:04,620
between

188
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,139
putting together a chassis and building

189
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:11,160
a chassis and this goes all over the

190
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:14,340
chassis all parts should fit nicely in

191
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:15,300
the sense they move freely but with zero

192
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,819
play

193
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,800
is the enemy of drifting keep in mind

194
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:22,259
always play is the enemy with drifting

195
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,180
if you have any play in your

196
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:27,300
steering

197
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:30,419
or in your arms or in your wheels

198
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:32,940
this will drive your gyro crazy your car

199
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:35,339
will be twerking all over the place so

200
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:37,200
this thing to keep in mind now there are

201
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:39,719
some rare situations where we have to

202
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,539
choose between either having a little

203
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:45,660
bit of play or a little bit of friction

204
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:49,440
for example let's say you're placing

205
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:51,480
your knuckle or your your arm and if you

206
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,700
place for example two shims it's a

207
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:57,180
little bit loose but if you place

208
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:59,160
another shim it's tight so in that

209
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:01,500
situation you have to improvise you have

210
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:04,560
to take that extra shim and sand it down

211
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:07,560
then keep at it try again until you lose

212
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:11,279
the play while maintaining a free motion

213
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,959
of the arm so the first thing that I do

214
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,600
when it comes to tuning the first thing

215
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,700
I adjust is my right height and if you

216
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,620
don't know what right height is it's a

217
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,360
bit simply the distance or the clearance

218
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:23,899
between the bottom of your chassis and

219
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:27,000
the ground I noticed that most guys run

220
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:29,580
2.2 or 2.3 I don't remember I think 2.3

221
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,740
millimeter up front and 2.5 millimeter

222
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:34,080
in the back so basically the chassis is

223
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:36,959
slightly leaning forward

224
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,959
yeah so it's slightly leaning forward

225
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:43,260
now for me and this is highly subjective

226
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:45,180
to your uh driving skill and what you

227
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:47,700
prefer when it comes to weight

228
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:50,519
distribution because the whole idea of

229
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:52,380
having right height tilted forward or

230
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:55,500
leaning backward is weight distribution

231
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:56,519
after all now for me when I do my right

232
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,220
height

233
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:01,800
I consider two things the first thing is

234
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:04,260
the overall weight of my chassis and the

235
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:07,140
strength of my Springs

236
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:11,100
and my goal the thing I want to achieve

237
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:13,440
is on acceleration I want my chassis to

238
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,120
squat little bit to the back

239
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,800
okay when I press acceleration the

240
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,060
chassis should slightly

241
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,060
lean to the back like this

242
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:30,660
is the same concept that we use in 110

243
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:33,839
two-wheel drive indoor buggies because

244
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:35,940
since it's a three wheel drive the more

245
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,459
leaning or the more weight shifting to

246
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:39,959
the back that means the more weight will

247
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:42,540
be on the rear wheel which are the

248
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:44,700
active wheel connected motor and this

249
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:47,160
way you will maintain constant Traction

250
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:50,880
in the back and constant forward motion

251
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:54,779
for example if I if my Springs were hard

252
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:56,579
my rear springs were hard and won't

253
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:58,500
acceleration nothing change if I crease

254
00:10:56,579 --> 00:11:01,620
acceleration the car slightly move in

255
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,940
the same right height I mean the shift

256
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,040
there's no shift at all because the

257
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:07,760
strings are hard in that case I

258
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,920
deliberately screw in my rear

259
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,959
droop screws slightly so my right height

260
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,820
would look like this standing still

261
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,560
because I know there's no weight shift

262
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:20,700
on acceleration because the Springs are

263
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:23,640
hard in case if my Springs are soft

264
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:25,860
and when I press acceleration I notice

265
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:28,800
that the body automatically leans to the

266
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:31,260
back in that case I set up my right

267
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,839
height to be parallel to the ground and

268
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:35,940
my preferred spot is about 2.5

269
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,640
millimeter all across

270
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:41,399
if I have to lean it to the back via

271
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,920
group screws I go three millimeters up

272
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:45,660
front and I go about 2.5 millimeters in

273
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,940
the rear and if you notice this chassis

274
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:49,079
now as it is it's slightly leaning to

275
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,480
the back

276
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:53,779
you can see the clearance here how big

277
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,779
it is

278
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:59,459
and here slightly smaller and if you

279
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,680
notice here also my drip screws are not

280
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:04,560
identical I did this deliberately to

281
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:07,980
show you if you noticed the the toe bar

282
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:10,019
here is not parallel to the ground so

283
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:12,540
my right group screw on the right side

284
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:15,000
here is shorter than the other I have to

285
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:18,320
screw this side slightly bit in to push

286
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,320
the chassis slightly down

287
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,500
this way

288
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,279
it's parallel to the ground so if I

289
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:28,019
release it you can notice my chassis is

290
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:29,880
tilted to the left side and this one of

291
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:32,880
the features that most guys don't pay

292
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:35,519
attention to and then at this setting if

293
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:38,459
I drive my car it will ride well but

294
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,980
because my chest is all tilted to this

295
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:43,019
side it will not be consistent when it

296
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:46,139
comes to Drifting then after I'm done

297
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:48,420
with my ride height the next thing that

298
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:50,880
I adjust is my track width and the check

299
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:53,279
width simply is the distance

300
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,500
between the center of your chassis and

301
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:58,079
the outer surface of your wheels it can

302
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,480
go either narrow or wide and this

303
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:02,399
depends on two factors of course the

304
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,899
main factor is your body

305
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,820
what type of body have do you have a

306
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:09,180
narrow body or wide body and the second

307
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:13,620
factor is the offset of your wheels okay

308
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:15,720
so basically you measure your body and

309
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:18,779
you try to mimic that on your chassis

310
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:21,420
for example if you have a narrow uh

311
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:22,980
chassis like the the XR is actually a

312
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,959
white dressing if you have I mean if you

313
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:28,019
have a low offset Tire

314
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:29,820
you have to undo your screws on the arms

315
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:31,680
the upper arms and the low arms so the

316
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:33,600
whole assembly goes outward and you

317
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,940
imagine measure the distance between the

318
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,920
wheels and try to mimic it or try to get

319
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,420
the same distance of your body and the

320
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,060
goal

321
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:44,820
is to have your wheels that flat with

322
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:47,160
your fenders see in the rear in the rear

323
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:49,079
if I if I go beyond my fenders on

324
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,360
acceleration since my body already

325
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:53,339
squats it will drop against the tire and

326
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:57,899
you will lose speed up front if you go

327
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:59,940
beyond your fenders on steering the

328
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:02,399
wheels will grab or will drop against

329
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:04,320
your Fender and will spin out

330
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,139
immediately

331
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,060
in the rear most of most of the cars in

332
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:11,279
the market right now there's no

333
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:13,380
adjustability for the width

334
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,540
at stock form you have to buy extra

335
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:17,160
parts and the mode and the extra part

336
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:19,620
that I'm talking about is the the rear

337
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,420
lower arm example for the xrx there are

338
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:24,420
two options you can go with the big with

339
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:26,339
the long uh lower arm lower rear arm or

340
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:28,500
there's an optional part which the lower

341
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:30,480
ear arm has a screw in it and it's

342
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,760
expandable itself you can adjust it up

343
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,519
and down but at the same time you have

344
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:37,740
to accumulate for the extra width so you

345
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,860
have to purchase the optional dog bone

346
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:42,660
which is I think 10.3 millimeter let's

347
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,940
document it for the extra width of your

348
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:47,639
chassis after you're done setting up

349
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,720
your trackpad the next step or for me

350
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:51,360
the next step that I go through

351
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,160
immediately is my Caster setting now if

352
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,560
you don't know what Caster is it's

353
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:58,019
simply the axis of rotation in your

354
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:00,360
front wheel so imagine if this is the

355
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:02,459
axis of rotation at this sitting when I

356
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,740
rotate my front wheel it will rotate

357
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:06,360
fourth and back around this axis now if

358
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:08,279
I adjust my Caster if I adjust this

359
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:11,579
angle slightly to the back the wheel

360
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:14,100
will rotate slightly down and up and if

361
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:16,199
I adjust more again down and up and

362
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:18,300
that's what explains uh what a lot of

363
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:21,000
players or Drifters are suffering from

364
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:23,040
it's called wheel lifting that means you

365
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,680
have too much Caster to the point that

366
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,180
one wheel is pushing against the angle

367
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,040
and lifting the other wheel of the

368
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:31,079
ground the front wheel of course now the

369
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,360
theory or or there is a forecaster or

370
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:36,060
the function of Caster is

371
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,680
something called or we call it in

372
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:40,620
drifting what we call it the coin effect

373
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,959
or the Frisbee effect imagine

374
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:45,240
if you are rotating your wheels

375
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:47,459
now this Caster let me get the max

376
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:50,339
Caster so you can see

377
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:53,339
now I have the max caster

378
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:54,600
when I'm at full lock you'll notice this

379
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:57,120
wheel

380
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,740
is tilted to the back and this is what

381
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,139
gives you the Frisbee effect or the coin

382
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,820
effect imagine if you throw a frisbee on

383
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:04,680
the ground or a coin on the ground the

384
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:07,440
coin will go in straight line until it

385
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:10,019
starts losing speed and then whatever

386
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,240
angle the coin is leaning at it will

387
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:15,420
start rotating toward that angle

388
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,699
until it reach the center lose speed and

389
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:21,060
then drop it's just low of Gravity by

390
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:22,620
Isaac Newton so this effect is very

391
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,480
important this is the most important

392
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:26,519
effect when it comes to adjusting not

393
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,899
adjusting when it comes to stabilizing

394
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:30,360
your drifting angle

395
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:32,160
let's put it to practice for example you

396
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:36,000
are drifting on this direction you're

397
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,920
rotating now your rear end is already at

398
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,180
higher speed so it's it's standing or

399
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,820
it's going to

400
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:44,220
spin forward what you do is you counter

401
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:46,980
act that you counter steel right

402
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:48,660
to catch your it from spinning out but

403
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:51,480
at the same time because you have too

404
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:54,000
much Caster this wheel is digging in

405
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,880
that direction meaning this wheel has

406
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,800
the tendency to rotate on that direction

407
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:01,139
as if your front wheel is digging on the

408
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:04,020
ground pushing your front to the

409
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:05,939
direction of your drift and preventing

410
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:08,040
you from spinning out

411
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:09,900
the way to adjust your Caster is

412
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:12,419
different from chassis to chassis some

413
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:15,000
chassis like the DK have Caster screw

414
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:18,000
you undo the screw then you are free to

415
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,220
push forth or back your upper arms front

416
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,980
upper arms to adjust your casters most

417
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:25,079
of the other chassis use shims if you

418
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,880
take a look here in your upper arm you

419
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:30,840
have a dead space that you have to place

420
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,880
cm in to prevent the extra play and at

421
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,740
the same time to adjust your Caster if

422
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,059
you plus your shims up front you push

423
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:38,039
the arm to the back so you get more

424
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:40,679
caster and vice versa and all the space

425
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:43,500
in between you can divide like shame in

426
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:47,160
front and shame in the back some other

427
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:50,160
chest is just like uh yes the the GLD

428
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:52,020
they have Caster block which is optional

429
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,179
this block you unscrew the two blocks

430
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:56,280
the two screws and you slide the whole

431
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:58,080
block forward and back if you have a GLD

432
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:01,260
you have to get the Caster block

433
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:03,419
otherwise it will not perform right

434
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:05,039
so at this point I I know what you're

435
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:06,780
thinking about how much he has a share

436
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,160
you should I use and it's a hard

437
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,660
question to answer because it's

438
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,760
subjective it depends on your driving

439
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:14,220
skills it depends on the surface you're

440
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,559
running on the type of tires and that

441
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,419
the type of chassis that you have and

442
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:21,660
the overall weight over the chassis that

443
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:24,000
you got on uh for me the way I do it uh

444
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:27,120
initially I start with Max caster and I

445
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,960
try it out if I don't have wheel lift I

446
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:33,299
stay at Max faster but if I start to see

447
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,820
we'll lift as if I'm driving a three

448
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:39,000
wheeler instead of four wheel contact I

449
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:41,820
reduce the Caster Some people prefer not

450
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,220
to reduce the Caster but to screw in the

451
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:46,500
front Loop screw meaning to reduce the

452
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:49,200
front right height and it's up to you

453
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:51,840
but initially start with Max caster and

454
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:55,020
test it the only side effect to Max

455
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:57,960
Caster is wheel lifting now after you're

456
00:18:55,020 --> 00:19:00,660
done testing various angles of caster

457
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:03,299
and eventually finding what Suits You

458
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:05,280
me I go immediately after that to my

459
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:07,380
camera setting and if you don't if you

460
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,780
don't know what camber is basically it's

461
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:12,900
the vertical relationship between your

462
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:15,000
wheels and the body so if my wheels is

463
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:18,000
straight parallel to my body it's called

464
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,160
zero camber now if my wheels start to

465
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,600
lean toward the body this is positive

466
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,640
camber

467
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,720
and the opposite direction is negative

468
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,840
camber

469
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:30,179
rule of thumb never use negative camber

470
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,740
your wheels should be either straight

471
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:33,539
to your body parallel to your body or

472
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:35,820
leading to all your body the only

473
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:40,140
situation where negative camber is

474
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:42,660
acceptable is in your front leading

475
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:45,600
wheel for example at full lock you can

476
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:48,480
see my front leading wheel here has a

477
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:51,840
negative camber

478
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:54,120
now the way I do it is at the beginning

479
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,400
I start with zero all around all my

480
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:59,400
wheels I place them or I adjust them to

481
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,500
be vertical or parallel to my body then

482
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,260
I test drive my assessing the whole

483
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:08,460
concept of camber is to gain traction or

484
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:11,539
to lose traction see at vertical sitting

485
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:14,760
that means your tire is maintaining full

486
00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:17,460
patch contact that means your tire is at

487
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:21,360
highest grip state or this is the

488
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:23,880
grippiest contact or the grippiest uh

489
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:26,940
Jackson you can get from your tires now

490
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:29,460
if I go just drive my car and I find it

491
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:31,860
that it's hard to lose traction to

492
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:34,140
initiate your drift I meaning I have to

493
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:36,600
really hit my throttle just to get my

494
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:39,720
rear end to swing that means I have too

495
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:42,780
much traction in the back so I start by

496
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:45,600
adding more camber slightly then I test

497
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:47,400
drive and then add a test drive and so

498
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,580
on until I feel comfortable with my

499
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:53,880
chassis I I became Miami until you get

500
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:56,640
to the point that it's predictable and

501
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,679
easy to initiate your drift and then you

502
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:03,059
stay at that angle regardless of what

503
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:05,880
angle 0 1 2 3 usually we don't go beyond

504
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:08,340
three three degrees camber

505
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,320
but that's how I do it for the rear now

506
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:13,799
in the front it's little bit different

507
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:16,679
because the point of camber in the front

508
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:19,080
not only traction but traction during

509
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:21,360
rotation during full lock and the way I

510
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,740
do it is I try

511
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,860
to achieve

512
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:28,559
maximum contact during full lock

513
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:29,880
in one of five wheels at least so in

514
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:33,200
case

515
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,200
let's see the xrx

516
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:39,900
for example here

517
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:42,059
at full lock you can see I managed to

518
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,620
get full contact on my leading wheel my

519
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:47,460
trailing wheel slightly lifting off the

520
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:50,100
ground it has positive camber but my

521
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:52,500
leading wheel almost almost has zero

522
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:55,679
camber and the way to to visualize it or

523
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:57,960
to to say that you have that is by

524
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,880
holding your chassis against a flat

525
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,679
surface like this and you can see I have

526
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,059
full contact here and if you can see in

527
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:06,299
the back there there's a point contact

528
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:08,700
so this tire maintains full grip at full

529
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:11,220
lock and this is what controls my

530
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:13,559
direction of motion

531
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:16,559
now after you finish your camber the

532
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:18,240
next step for me is to set up my toe if

533
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,760
you don't know what toe is it's the

534
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,280
relationship between each wheel the

535
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:25,440
front together and the rear together so

536
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:28,140
for example if my wheels are parallel to

537
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:30,059
each other this is called a zero tall

538
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,740
if they started to lean toward each

539
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:33,960
other from the front it's called

540
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:35,580
positive tool and it goes the opposite

541
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,840
direction it's called negative two now

542
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:39,659
in the rear you have the option of

543
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:41,820
running either parallel which is zero or

544
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:44,039
you can run positive one degree two

545
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:46,020
degree Three Degree up to you and the

546
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:47,400
front you have extra options you can run

547
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:49,799
it either zero

548
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,780
you can run it negative meaning leaning

549
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:54,000
to it sorry a positive meaning leaning

550
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:56,159
toward each other or you can run it

551
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,559
negative pointing away from each other

552
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:01,500
let's talk about the video first what's

553
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,820
the the functionality of of the toe and

554
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,940
there's a debate when it comes to the

555
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:08,159
rear uh most guys in in the 110

556
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:11,340
Community they prefer to run parallel

557
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:13,500
and some of them prefer to run toe n and

558
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:16,260
the the concept behind that for example

559
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:17,340
let's say you started to initiate your

560
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:19,500
drift

561
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:22,320
to the side to the right side now your

562
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:24,480
rear end is already swinging and at the

563
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,220
same time you're counter steering to

564
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,080
catch your rear end from

565
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:31,820
spinning beyond your front wheel and

566
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,820
spinning out so at this point

567
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:36,900
this end is going front and if your real

568
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:39,179
rear tires that give me something

569
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:40,919
straight let's say this is the direction

570
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:43,039
of your rear tires they're pointing this

571
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:46,260
way if you rear tires at this position

572
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:47,760
it's easier for you to spin out but if

573
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:50,700
you're leading

574
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:54,140
rear wheel is slightly toe and meaning

575
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:54,140
pushing to that direction

576
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:58,520
let me get the camera right sorry

577
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:03,780
if you're real a real leading wheel this

578
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:05,820
wheel which are we are drifting on this

579
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:08,159
direction if this wheel is not pointing

580
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:10,559
straight but slightly leaning inward to

581
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:13,620
end that means this wheel will counter

582
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:15,600
at the action of the spin so it will

583
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:17,400
stabilize your rear end from spinning

584
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,440
out and it will make it easier for you

585
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:22,500
to hold your drift without spinning out

586
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,340
to me I prefer to have my rear toes set

587
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,900
to 3

588
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:28,140
3 but it's different from player to

589
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:32,100
player so I start in every chassis with

590
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:34,200
zero and I tried the slide I add add

591
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:35,640
more angles more to n until I feel

592
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:39,059
comfortable and you should do the same

593
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:40,380
this is for the year now for the front

594
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:43,980
you have

595
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:47,340
different angle you can go to n zero or

596
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:50,700
toe out and that the idea behind that in

597
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:53,460
the front is not just to counteract the

598
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:56,100
direct angle is to

599
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:59,340
shape your steering geometry the way you

600
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:01,200
like it for example if I have

601
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:03,299
let me get another chassis easier to

602
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,700
show for example the trz

603
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:08,820
if I have for example here if you see a

604
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:11,700
half slightly negative toe negative

605
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:14,640
minus one actually so the reason for

606
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:16,880
that if I have negative 2 during full

607
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,880
lock

608
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,820
I will get something called parallel

609
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:23,940
Ackerman we'll talk about that later

610
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:26,159
meaning at full lock my two wheels are

611
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:28,440
parallel to each other at this Angle now

612
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,480
if I have for example if I don't have

613
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,159
this just you know if I have two out

614
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,919
which I don't like I never used to I

615
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,779
would have to out at the front when I

616
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:38,279
turn at full lock

617
00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:41,279
your

618
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:42,900
leading wheel will be almost 90 degree

619
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,740
more than this it will be almost like

620
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:46,159
this

621
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:48,659
but your training wheel would be off

622
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:52,080
slightly less angle that you're leading

623
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:54,960
wheel now and if you have it zero it

624
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:57,240
will most likely be the same the way I

625
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:01,740
do it I usually go for either parallel

626
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:03,779
or zero sorry uh one degree two n so I

627
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,820
can get Federal acronym at each angle

628
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:08,039
now if you notice here

629
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:10,380
you can see my wheel is rubbing I guess

630
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:11,940
the shot this is not my steering

631
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:13,740
geometry this is not the angle because

632
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:15,900
you're not keeping in mind the weight of

633
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:18,480
the body and the electronics

634
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:20,220
so at full when I when I place it on the

635
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,260
ground it will look like this it will

636
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:24,179
still spin freely and that one thing you

637
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:27,480
have to consider also sometimes you go

638
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:30,600
with negative to a front your tire

639
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:32,460
trailing Tire will will turn so much to

640
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,740
the point that it drops against the

641
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:37,080
shock so if you have that problem either

642
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:40,080
you have to increase your width or you

643
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:43,440
have to go with a bigger offset wheel or

644
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:45,299
you have to lower your right height

645
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,860
for example this is the right high C if

646
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:49,200
I lower the right height the whole

647
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:50,760
steering geometry will change

648
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,460
and at this point

649
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:55,679
my tire doesn't even go that far but if

650
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:57,480
I drop it down the tire will go far to

651
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:00,600
the point that it contacts

652
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:02,460
after I'm done with my toe sitting I

653
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,799
immediately start adjusting my agreement

654
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:06,840
and by far this is the step where I

655
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:10,260
spend most of my time at when it comes

656
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:11,760
to tuning my sensing I experiment until

657
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:14,640
I find with suits me of course and

658
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,740
everybody should do the same and if you

659
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,320
are unable to hold your sliding angles

660
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:21,900
for long duration of time then most

661
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:24,240
probably your acne needs more work and

662
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,860
if you don't know what Ackerman is it's

663
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,860
the relationship between your front

664
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:31,260
wheel throughout the range of motion now

665
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:35,100
at neutral position you can see that you

666
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:38,100
either have zero toe or two n or two out

667
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:41,100
correct now during your motion when you

668
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:42,600
turn your radio or your wheels the

669
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:45,919
relationship between those two wheels

670
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,919
it's called Ackerman

671
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:51,480
now when it comes to Ackerman you have

672
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:54,000
three options that you can run your

673
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:57,659
chassis option number one is positive

674
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,419
Acumen which means at foot lock

675
00:27:57,659 --> 00:28:02,279
your leading wheel has more steering

676
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:05,640
lock than your trailing wheel just like

677
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:08,159
this and most of drifters run this

678
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:10,740
option it makes sense because this is

679
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:13,500
the option at which your car is most

680
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:16,200
Nimble at meaning at this option you

681
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:19,020
have the ability or ease of switching

682
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:21,960
from side to side in case if you have a

683
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:23,580
course with a lot of turns and angles so

684
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:26,820
this is option number one option number

685
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:29,400
two is to run a parallel Ackerman which

686
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:31,080
means that your wheels at full lock are

687
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,820
parallel to each other

688
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:35,760
and this is the option that you should

689
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:38,460
run if you have a course which has list

690
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:40,679
tracks oh sorry listeners but long

691
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:42,480
sweeping angles so you have you want to

692
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:44,520
have the ability to hold your angle for

693
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,200
a long duration of time this is the best

694
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:48,299
option for you also if you want to grab

695
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,460
walk this is the best option for you and

696
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:52,860
there's the last option which is a

697
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:54,900
reverse acronym or known as negative

698
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:57,539
acronym also which means the opposite

699
00:28:54,900 --> 00:29:00,840
your leading wheel has more angle lock

700
00:28:57,539 --> 00:29:03,480
than your trailing wheel and this is the

701
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:05,159
easiest setup to crap up

702
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,900
from the beginning if you have no

703
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:08,880
experience with the cap walking this is

704
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:10,440
the easiest setup to grab work but keep

705
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,179
in mind because this angle is different

706
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,880
than this angle they will fight each

707
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:17,700
other and you will lose speed you'll be

708
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,080
able to carpool that slowly and if you

709
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,880
have a small track it's not a big

710
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,919
problem but for longer track you will

711
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,240
hold the whole traffic behind you now

712
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:26,279
here where it gets a little bit

713
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,200
confusing before you go on and start

714
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:31,020
adjusting your Ackerman you need to know

715
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,640
that Ackerman adjustment is sensitive to

716
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:34,679
six factors

717
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,820
the first factor is your steering

718
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:38,760
assembly

719
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:42,899
then your track width your right height

720
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:44,399
your toe your caster and the level the

721
00:29:42,899 --> 00:29:46,440
vertical distance or the vertical

722
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:48,120
difference between your steering

723
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:50,100
assembly and your knuckles

724
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:52,320
so steering system what does that mean

725
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:55,140
or a steering assembly simply it means

726
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:57,179
the way that your Servo is connected to

727
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:59,279
your front wheels and as of now there

728
00:29:57,179 --> 00:30:01,500
are three systems in the market the

729
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:03,720
first one which is my favorite it's the

730
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:06,600
direct connection meaning your wheels

731
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:08,940
are connected via VIA your steering

732
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,740
links directly to your Servo horn a

733
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:12,419
t-shaped Servo horn this is number one

734
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:15,000
number two there's something called

735
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:18,059
sliding rack either curved sliding Rack

736
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,580
or flat or straight sliding rack and in

737
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:23,880
this situation you have your Servo with

738
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:25,980
your Servo horn connected to a metal bar

739
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:28,440
this bar is sandwiched between ball

740
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:30,840
bearing and then it connects to your

741
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:33,960
steering links to your wheels

742
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:36,480
like the this is the GLD same system as

743
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:40,799
the xrx also same principle same concept

744
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:43,320
and the flat steering rack is like the

745
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:45,779
Geo the B embracing Dr Z1 there is a

746
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:48,600
rack seems similar to the drg and xrx RX

747
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:50,760
but it's a flat track straight rack same

748
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,740
concept and then the third option

749
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:55,559
available in the market right now it's

750
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:58,080
called buildcrank it's a t-shaped plate

751
00:30:55,559 --> 00:31:00,779
which are screwed which is screwed over

752
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,700
your body the base plate of your body uh

753
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:05,760
via ball bearing

754
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:07,440
and then on each side it's connected up

755
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,240
front to your steering link to your

756
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,760
wheels and in the middle it has a ball

757
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:13,679
ball link which connects your Servo horn

758
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,700
just like this

759
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,700
it's called buildcrank

760
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:21,840
and this is this is four wheel drive AMZ

761
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:23,460
and this system is the system that I

762
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:27,419
least like actually I hate the system

763
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:30,240
because it it has a tendency for

764
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:33,120
vertical movement or vertical wiggling

765
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,799
in your steering link itself

766
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,080
unlike

767
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:38,340
the ball bearing sliding rack the rack

768
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:40,799
is already sandwiched between ball

769
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:43,860
bearings so there's no movement other

770
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,760
than side to side very very stable and

771
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,860
uh

772
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:50,700
this system in my opinion in the market

773
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:53,399
is the direct connection because direct

774
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:57,240
connection system allows the designer to

775
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:59,039
have a sliding Servo Mount which simply

776
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:01,679
will adjust your agreement without any

777
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:03,600
headache now the second factor to

778
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:06,179
consider when you are adjusting your

779
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,860
Ackerman is your front track width now

780
00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:09,899
if you are planning to run a positive

781
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:12,179
Ackerman you have no problem you're

782
00:32:09,899 --> 00:32:14,100
attracted you can run any any width you

783
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:16,080
want and you will get positive Ackerman

784
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:17,640
with no issues but if you are planning

785
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,220
to go for a parallel agreement or

786
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:22,140
reverse acronym negative Ackerman then

787
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:25,620
you should your trackpad will come to

788
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:29,220
play in the sense for example

789
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:31,020
this is white setting even then if you

790
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:33,179
can see here my wheel is dropping

791
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:35,520
against the shock so in that case you

792
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:37,679
have to run a wider frontal track width

793
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:39,960
so as you can get clearance at full lock

794
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:41,279
without your wheel rubbing the shock if

795
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:44,399
you restart rubbing the shock

796
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:46,500
immediately it will push this wheel into

797
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:49,500
a halt and you will spin out immediately

798
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:50,820
the third factor to consider is the

799
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:53,340
right height

800
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:56,399
now for example this car is tuned

801
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:58,200
perfectly parallel Ackerman okay and if

802
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:00,179
you take a look here

803
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,919
you'll notice this this wheel the

804
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:04,440
leading the trailing wheel is already

805
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:06,419
rubbing against the shock because this

806
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:08,820
is not my right height you have to

807
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:10,919
consider your electronics I mean in that

808
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:13,019
case my battery and my body which will

809
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:15,240
in turn push the front little bit so

810
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:17,580
let's see now it's rubbing

811
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:19,440
a little bit pressure

812
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:21,419
this will be easier

813
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:24,980
you hear now it's rubbing with why apply

814
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:24,980
a little bit pressure see what happens

815
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:30,000
this is my right height so at full lock

816
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,260
I have no problem with my tire rubbing

817
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,240
against the shock

818
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:36,480
now the fourth factor that comes into

819
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:39,419
play is your tone which means your

820
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,640
steering links length themselves before

821
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:44,460
the steps before I started this step

822
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:46,919
usually I just install my wheels with no

823
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:49,559
steering links and I cannot rotate them

824
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:51,840
forth and back to see if I have an issue

825
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:55,080
clearing my shock in my trailing wheel

826
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:57,779
or creating my lower body plate in my

827
00:33:55,080 --> 00:34:00,059
leading wheel after that I pre-measured

828
00:33:57,779 --> 00:34:02,000
the distance between the ball link of

829
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:05,279
the knuckle and the steering assembly

830
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,559
mimic that into my steering legs itself

831
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:09,980
and install them to to check the

832
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:15,179
clearance if it works or not and usually

833
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:17,520
if you have your link sitting at the toe

834
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:19,800
out in neutral position that means you

835
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:23,399
will get a positive agreement at full

836
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:25,859
lock like this and if you have your toe

837
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:28,320
zero just like my car here slightly

838
00:34:25,859 --> 00:34:30,060
actually it's a positive slight positive

839
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,080
but because this is not my setup my

840
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:33,780
setup

841
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:36,060
when I squat my car a little bit more

842
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:38,220
likely close to parallel so that's the

843
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:40,320
thing at full lock

844
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:42,599
I'll get better agreement and if you go

845
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,339
the opposite direction which is toe and

846
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:46,859
at neutral

847
00:34:44,339 --> 00:34:49,800
that means you'll get reverse acronym

848
00:34:46,859 --> 00:34:52,200
meaning your

849
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,820
your trading wheel will be at more angle

850
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,740
than your leading wheel

851
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:59,099
now the fifth factor that can affect

852
00:34:55,740 --> 00:35:01,140
your Ackerman setup is your Caster value

853
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:03,599
and what I mean by that is the

854
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:05,640
horizontal relationship means fourth or

855
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:07,740
back the relationship between your

856
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:10,200
steering assembly and your knuckle this

857
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:12,240
is the xrx take a look at the ball Link

858
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:14,280
at the steering assembly here and the

859
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,560
ball Link at the knuckle you can see

860
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:19,079
they're almost at the same angle or

861
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:22,079
parallel to each other at same line

862
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:24,119
now if this ball link

863
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:25,320
at the knuckle we're positioned a little

864
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:27,540
bit back

865
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:29,760
or a little bit fourth the whole

866
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:31,980
Ackerman geometry will change for

867
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:35,460
example let's take a car that has an an

868
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:38,460
easy Caster adjustment yes yeah the GLD

869
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:40,859
for example take a look at my toe at

870
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:42,480
maximum Caster keep in mind the steering

871
00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:44,940
link has not changed I did not play with

872
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,700
my steer link but I increased my Caster

873
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:51,960
so at this position I have a 12. now if

874
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:54,480
I decrease my Caster watch my wheels

875
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:56,160
my toe will change

876
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,540
let's take something more clear for

877
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,040
example

878
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:02,280
the DK

879
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:05,240
same concept if I go Max caster

880
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,240
watch my toe

881
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,480
see the difference

882
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:13,619
and again

883
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:16,740
the trc2

884
00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:21,200
this is the Caster screw for the trc2 if

885
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:21,200
I change my Caster take a look at my toe

886
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:31,980
so when you change your Caster your toe

887
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:34,440
will change at neutral position which

888
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:35,400
means it will change your accurate at

889
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:38,220
full lock

890
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:40,260
now the last factor to look out for when

891
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:41,640
you adjusting your Ackerman is the

892
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:43,920
vertical relationship between your

893
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:46,440
steering assembly and your knuckle and

894
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,820
what I mean by that is take a look at

895
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,619
the Bold link

896
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:51,780
at my steering assembly and the bone

897
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:54,960
Link at my knuckle see the difference in

898
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:56,579
level if this level change say to this

899
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:00,359
point if I push my arm a little bit

900
00:36:56,579 --> 00:37:02,400
higher if this level change

901
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:04,980
it will affect my Ackerman and the way

902
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:07,640
to see this is to place your chassis at

903
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,640
a flat surface

904
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:12,300
and now take a look at my trailing wheel

905
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:15,180
the down wheel here if I reduce my right

906
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:17,579
height meaning I pushed my front car

907
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:19,760
down see what happens to my trailing

908
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:19,760
wheel

909
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:29,280
that's why before I start anything any

910
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:31,740
adjustment at all in my chassis the

911
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,780
first thing I set is my right height

912
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:35,640
another question I get a lot of times

913
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:38,760
regarding

914
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:42,260
stealing geometry is why do I bend my

915
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:44,820
steering links or when should you do it

916
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:48,180
if you have a car

917
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:51,359
that has a fixed Servo Mount and you are

918
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:53,880
running a front wide track and at the

919
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:56,339
same time you want to have a parallel

920
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:58,140
Ackerman without sacrificing your

921
00:37:56,339 --> 00:38:00,359
maximum steering lock this is the

922
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:03,540
situation where you need to bend your

923
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:06,420
steering links for example let's take a

924
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:09,240
look at this the BM bracing DRZ for

925
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:12,020
example imagine if I'm let me get

926
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,020
something pointy

927
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:18,000
imagine if I'm running a straight

928
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:20,540
standard straight steering links at

929
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,540
certain point

930
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:26,820
the link itself because it's straight it

931
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:30,000
will Jam against the knuckle so this is

932
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:32,280
the maximum steering if I am if I was

933
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,079
running a straight steel link because at

934
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:36,599
this point the ceiling link again it

935
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:40,020
will rub and jam against your knuckle

936
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:42,720
itself so to get the maximum Ackerman or

937
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:45,720
parallel Ackerman at this setting I will

938
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:47,880
have to run my

939
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:51,359
leading wheel at this position so this

940
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:53,460
will be my maximum steering lock with

941
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:55,440
straight steering Link at parallel

942
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:57,660
Ackerman which is still good still

943
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:01,320
impressive and it will perform well but

944
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:04,560
what if I want to run maximum

945
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:07,560
lock with parallel Ackerman at this

946
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:10,200
point to clear this point

947
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:11,220
of the knuckle I need to bend it in a

948
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,800
way

949
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:17,720
the steering link will wrap around the

950
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:17,720
knuckle without rubbing like this

951
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:25,740
after I'm done with my tuning I install

952
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:29,579
my electronics for the first time

953
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:31,380
my ESC my Servo my gyro everything with

954
00:39:29,579 --> 00:39:33,720
the battery on then I mount my body

955
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:36,480
after I mount my body then I start

956
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:38,480
adjusting my suspension what we mean by

957
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,820
suspicion is your

958
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:43,800
shock itself the shock position either

959
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:45,660
vertical or horizontal and the type of

960
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:48,000
spring that you'll use medium soft or

961
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:50,880
hard and it all depends on you generally

962
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,160
speaking the softer suspension will give

963
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,480
you more traction more Tire grip the

964
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:57,540
harder suspension will give you less

965
00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:01,440
traction less tire grip and if you are

966
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:04,260
planning to go for a maximum body roll

967
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:07,200
then you need to have a vertical

968
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:09,060
position shocks so a vertical position

969
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,339
shock it's the position at which the

970
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:12,960
shock is easier to compress the more

971
00:40:11,339 --> 00:40:14,880
angular shock you'll have the more

972
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,800
resistant to Vertical compress generally

973
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:19,079
speaking even in one tip

974
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,520
and if you want to buy the roll I don't

975
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:23,880
like Body Rolls but if you want to body

976
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:27,000
roll you need to have your Springs soft

977
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:29,520
your shocks at vertical position and you

978
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:32,040
need to mount the most weight at the top

979
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:34,200
plate ESC battery everything if you can

980
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:37,079
mount everything at the top plate so you

981
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:40,440
have a high CG High center of gravity

982
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:42,839
this way when you turn in an angle the

983
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:45,660
higher position of your weight

984
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:47,760
at combined with the softer spring and

985
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:49,740
the vertical position of your shocks it

986
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,839
will allow your body to lean on one side

987
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:54,300
than the other side and yet if you want

988
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:57,180
to have a more effect of body roll you

989
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:59,280
need monoshocks just like this of course

990
00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:01,920
you need it both front and rear

991
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,780
and you can see the effect right away if

992
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,500
I press here the car the chassis Will

993
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:06,500
Roll to the other side

994
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:12,480
initially this is the the Monoshock that

995
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:14,099
I got for my xrx I use it with my xrx

996
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,680
initially and because

997
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:17,820
I'm using a heavy Die Cast body for my

998
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:20,579
exercise I don't want to change this

999
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:23,460
body it's too much the roll is too much

1000
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:25,619
to the point that when I steer at one

1001
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:27,540
angle I feel that my chassis is dragging

1002
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:30,119
to that angle it's impressive impressive

1003
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:31,500
on video but it's it's not a good

1004
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:34,339
feeling on the radio

1005
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:37,560
so at this point I'm done with my

1006
00:41:34,339 --> 00:41:40,200
initial tuning and then I start the

1007
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:42,900
process of fine tuning which takes at

1008
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:45,540
least one month for me to fine tune one

1009
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:48,599
car and the reason for that is even

1010
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:50,220
though my car is set up

1011
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:51,839
at this

1012
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:54,119
level

1013
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:57,780
I don't know exactly how it will handle

1014
00:41:54,119 --> 00:42:00,780
on the track so I drive it for few days

1015
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:02,700
and then I start making small adjustment

1016
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:04,980
when I say a small adjustment mean I

1017
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:06,720
will change one thing at a time and test

1018
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:08,700
drive it for at least three battery

1019
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,800
packs then make the adjustment another

1020
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:12,780
adjustment and three packs and so on the

1021
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,599
reason for that is whenever you make an

1022
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:18,420
adjustment initially it will feel weird

1023
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:20,520
to you the control will feel off not

1024
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:22,260
because the adjustment is bad because

1025
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:24,359
you are not used to it so you have to

1026
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:26,760
give your time you give yourself time

1027
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:29,339
between each adjustment to just to see

1028
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:31,560
if you can adapt to this adjustment if

1029
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:34,020
you can if you can get the right muscle

1030
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:36,740
memory down to control the car at that

1031
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:39,540
sitting and then move to the next

1032
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:42,119
adjustments so it takes time at least a

1033
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:45,180
month for me to to fine tune my car to

1034
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:47,520
be exactly or to to just exactly the way

1035
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:49,380
I like it and there's nothing more

1036
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:51,000
satisfying in this hobby besides

1037
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:52,380
building the car which is fun after

1038
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,300
building the car there's nothing more

1039
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:56,640
satisfying in this hobby than to get

1040
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:58,500
your car to drive exactly the way you

1041
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:02,700
want it

1042
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:04,200
electronic wise when it comes to soft or

1043
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:07,140
smooth drifting the most important

1044
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:09,480
things to me are the servo and the

1045
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:11,579
motoring ESC combo Circle you need to

1046
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:13,859
have a good Servo not mediocre a good

1047
00:43:11,579 --> 00:43:15,119
Servo don't scam up on your Servo it's

1048
00:43:13,859 --> 00:43:19,200
very important

1049
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:22,140
yes sorry gyro wise any mediocre child

1050
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:23,940
will do for me because the function of

1051
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:26,579
the gyro is to assist you not to drive

1052
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:30,839
the car and to me I use all my Gyros at

1053
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:34,200
40 to 50 Max I feel that when I try it

1054
00:43:30,839 --> 00:43:36,780
at 70 or 80 percent not because not not

1055
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:39,060
just it will start to Jitter I feel that

1056
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:40,740
it it starts to fight me when I'm

1057
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:42,960
driving I feel that I'm fighting the car

1058
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:44,880
the general is over correcting me when I

1059
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,640
don't want any correction it prevents me

1060
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:49,319
from holding uh large angles so I don't

1061
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:51,599
like that feeling this is regarding the

1062
00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:54,060
gyro and I always face my gyro at lower

1063
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:56,099
position if possible in all my cars my

1064
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:59,819
gyro is always at the bottom

1065
00:43:56,099 --> 00:44:01,260
like so always at the bottom here

1066
00:43:59,819 --> 00:44:03,900
Electronics

1067
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:06,060
it's better if you have the money to go

1068
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:08,940
straight for censored system this is the

1069
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:10,800
smooth smooth system that you can get

1070
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:13,619
with a low power because drifting most

1071
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,819
fuel drifting is at lower power but it's

1072
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:16,980
not

1073
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:18,839
important per se if you are tight on

1074
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:20,700
budget you can still go for a sensorless

1075
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:23,520
system and with little bit of tweaking

1076
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:26,220
get a smoother acceleration at lower

1077
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:27,420
speed and the way I do it of course you

1078
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:30,060
have three factors that come into

1079
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:32,300
consideration your motor itself

1080
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:36,480
your sensorless ESC

1081
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:38,640
and your radio first of all your motor

1082
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,859
and before I start some of you might be

1083
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,720
wondering I already have a sensorless

1084
00:44:40,859 --> 00:44:45,720
system and it's smooth as butter right

1085
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:47,520
of course and most likely that's the

1086
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:49,800
case because you've never tried a

1087
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,359
censored system before imagine the

1088
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:54,420
difference or how can I explain it to

1089
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:56,520
you imagine you have a real car

1090
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:58,980
a driven car not a man not an automatic

1091
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:00,599
car stick driven car but it's missing

1092
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:03,660
the first gear

1093
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:06,000
try to roll that car from zero to

1094
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:08,040
Rolling and from Total desktop try to

1095
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,319
roll that car without using the first

1096
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:12,599
gear you will be able to roll it but

1097
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:15,060
initially it will be a small kick or

1098
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:18,359
you'll feel a small jerk before the car

1099
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:21,180
start rolling the same thing goes with

1100
00:45:18,359 --> 00:45:23,819
sensorless system

1101
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:25,200
even if you are very sensitive or very

1102
00:45:23,819 --> 00:45:28,260
gentle with your trigger finger

1103
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:30,780
initially of course first you will have

1104
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:34,079
slight dead band a range of motion that

1105
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:36,960
nothing happening then once you engage

1106
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:39,240
your motor you will first hear some

1107
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:41,460
clicking sounds and then after that the

1108
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:43,740
car will slightly jump then start

1109
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:45,720
rolling with sensorless with the

1110
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:49,319
sensored system you don't have that from

1111
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:51,839
zero there's no dead band and smoothly

1112
00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:54,300
from zero till full

1113
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:56,220
speed the car will go at consistent

1114
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:58,260
acceleration and that's what we are

1115
00:45:56,220 --> 00:46:00,119
trying to achieve with sensorless system

1116
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:03,180
so the way to go about this first of

1117
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:07,200
course your your motor itself if you are

1118
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:10,380
a beginner get 3500 KB motor 3500 KB

1119
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:13,619
motor is a high torque low speed motor

1120
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:16,560
remember this is not a razor speed is

1121
00:46:13,619 --> 00:46:19,680
not the goal here what we aiming for is

1122
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:22,920
the smoothness of your slide and overall

1123
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:25,440
style and in that case torque is more

1124
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:27,900
important to you than speed so this is

1125
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,760
regarding the KV and now if you have any

1126
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:31,859
previous experience with drifting or are

1127
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:34,680
seeing in general it's better to go for

1128
00:46:31,859 --> 00:46:37,200
something between 5000 to 7000 KV this

1129
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:39,420
is the sweet spot for me anyway now

1130
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:41,700
after you chose your your KV your

1131
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:44,640
appropriate KV motor for your skill the

1132
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:46,680
second thing is to go for your opinion

1133
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:49,380
which is the blue gear that we have here

1134
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:51,839
now general rule

1135
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:54,540
if you have a small opinion

1136
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:58,380
you will have a faster initial

1137
00:46:54,540 --> 00:47:00,780
acceleration but lower top speed and if

1138
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:04,880
you have a bigger pinion gear you will

1139
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:08,040
have initial low acceleration but faster

1140
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:09,480
top speed if that makes any sense and

1141
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:12,240
just to build it in action for example

1142
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:14,460
if you have two cars say the car on the

1143
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:17,160
right have 15 to spin in and the car on

1144
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:19,740
the left have for example 25 pinion if

1145
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:22,260
we start racing initially the car on the

1146
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:25,380
right will take off but with time the

1147
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:27,359
car on the left will catch up and go

1148
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:30,180
beyond the current lift if that makes

1149
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:32,160
any sense so using that concept into

1150
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:34,200
your advantage and especially if you are

1151
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:36,000
running a sensorless system the first

1152
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:37,980
week that you can do to get a smoother

1153
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,180
acceleration out of your motor is to

1154
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:41,099
Gear Up

1155
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:43,619
usually most of the cars in the market

1156
00:47:41,099 --> 00:47:47,040
they come with a size 14 15 or 16

1157
00:47:43,619 --> 00:47:49,740
toothpine what I personally do is I

1158
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:53,280
always go above the standard by five to

1159
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:56,640
six tips meaning for example the xrx the

1160
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:59,579
advice to use 15. my smallest gear I

1161
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:03,060
have is 21 and I have another gear 25 25

1162
00:47:59,579 --> 00:48:04,500
is smoother than 21 for me at least and

1163
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:06,119
I know what you're thinking wait a

1164
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:08,700
minute gearing up will cause heating

1165
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:11,220
issues to my to my car and you're

1166
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:14,099
correct if you are running a buggy a

1167
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:15,960
troggy on-road racing car anything that

1168
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:18,839
has rubber tires that maintain constant

1169
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:20,579
grip to the ground and you Gear Up you

1170
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:23,339
most likely will end up either frying

1171
00:48:20,579 --> 00:48:25,740
your ESC or demagnetizing your motor but

1172
00:48:23,339 --> 00:48:28,800
remember these small things are sliders

1173
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:30,660
they wait very little and they run on

1174
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,819
plastic wheels that has minimal traction

1175
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:35,339
and in all my cars I've never

1176
00:48:32,819 --> 00:48:37,319
experienced any heating issues for

1177
00:48:35,339 --> 00:48:38,520
example I told you this one I run it

1178
00:48:37,319 --> 00:48:40,980
I'll run it I will show some videos

1179
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:44,040
running 25 life to see the smoothness of

1180
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:47,700
it of it and with 25 no hitting shoe for

1181
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:49,619
example the DK

1182
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:53,099
comes with this pinion

1183
00:48:49,619 --> 00:48:55,200
16th opinion and I run it with 27 tooth

1184
00:48:53,099 --> 00:48:57,900
pinion

1185
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:59,460
and there's no heating issue this one is

1186
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:02,099
smooth don't get me wrong it's smooth

1187
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:03,900
it's good this one feels like you're

1188
00:49:02,099 --> 00:49:06,119
gliding on Ice that's the difference

1189
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:07,859
between the two after gearing the second

1190
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:11,040
factor that will affect your smoothness

1191
00:49:07,859 --> 00:49:13,140
is your ESC itself always try to get a

1192
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:15,599
programmable the ESC something that will

1193
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:18,000
accept a Programming Card that you can

1194
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:19,740
use to adjust your values and the most

1195
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,660
important value is something called

1196
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:24,359
Punch If you don't know what punch is

1197
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:27,480
it's the initial current sent from your

1198
00:49:24,359 --> 00:49:30,780
ESC to your motor to get the lowest

1199
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:33,780
possible speed of rotation and the way I

1200
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:38,700
do it I always in all my car I use punch

1201
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:41,220
one meaning when I engage my trigger the

1202
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:44,640
initial power sent is just enough to get

1203
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:48,060
my car to roll keep in mind some bad

1204
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:50,640
sensorless sorry specialist motors with

1205
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:52,920
punch one you might feel a little bit of

1206
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:55,260
Jitter or twitch if you have such motor

1207
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:57,420
then increase your value a little bit go

1208
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:59,760
for two or three but always stay at a

1209
00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:01,260
lower punch value the last thing that

1210
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,940
you can do to get a smoother

1211
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:05,280
acceleration out of your sensorless

1212
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:07,800
system is by adjusting your radio itself

1213
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:10,079
now the throttle or the acceleration

1214
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:11,880
which is the relation between your

1215
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:14,400
trigger finger and your and your motor

1216
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:17,160
is linear meaning for example if I move

1217
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:20,040
my trigger by the value of 1 the motor

1218
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:22,079
will spin at the value funnel speed wise

1219
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:24,420
and if I go for two it will go at speed

1220
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:26,880
of 2 3 speed of 3 and so on so the

1221
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:29,040
relation between them are linear what I

1222
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:31,380
want to do is for example I want to

1223
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:34,440
press the value of 1 but I want my car

1224
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:37,079
to move at the value of 0.5 or 0.6 less

1225
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:38,520
then speed wise this than my trigger

1226
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:41,339
finger and this is something called

1227
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:42,660
negative throttle curve for example

1228
00:50:41,339 --> 00:50:44,400
let's take a look here I'm not sure if

1229
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:48,260
this is going to pick up correctly

1230
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,260
this is no this is the DRZ

1231
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:52,819
xrx

1232
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:56,960
go to throttle

1233
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:00,440
better lock here

1234
00:51:01,319 --> 00:51:04,760
for example go to throttle

1235
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:11,160
see here it says curve for example now

1236
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:13,079
you see the curve the standard curve

1237
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:15,119
looks like this it's the linear I press

1238
00:51:13,079 --> 00:51:18,359
one it moves at speed of one and so on

1239
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:20,700
what I have is negative 45 throttle

1240
00:51:18,359 --> 00:51:22,619
curve negative meaning when I press the

1241
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:25,319
acceleration initially the call will

1242
00:51:22,619 --> 00:51:27,480
move at small at slower speed until it

1243
00:51:25,319 --> 00:51:29,160
reached the point of 50 percent halfway

1244
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:31,980
through the throttle after that it will

1245
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:34,559
shoot up another way to look at it is uh

1246
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:36,480
the first 50 of my throttle is my

1247
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:38,579
playing range the range which I drift

1248
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:42,059
most of at most of the time at and the

1249
00:51:38,579 --> 00:51:44,520
second half is my turbo boost when I go

1250
00:51:42,059 --> 00:51:46,680
to the second half the engine will rev

1251
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:49,500
at higher speed full speed in that case

1252
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:53,280
here I'm if I'm using for example this

1253
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:56,059
is 6000 KB right so the first 50 of my

1254
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:58,800
throttle link the the motor only produce

1255
00:51:56,059 --> 00:52:01,140
3000 worth of KV

1256
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:03,059
and the second half if I press full

1257
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:05,339
acceleration it will unlock the full

1258
00:52:03,059 --> 00:52:07,980
potential of the motor to full speed and

1259
00:52:05,339 --> 00:52:09,480
this way I have a better control over my

1260
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:13,079
lower speed

1261
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:16,079
now after you finish building and tuning

1262
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:17,940
your car we come to the third step which

1263
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:21,420
is the most important thing is your

1264
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:23,460
drifting skills this is the time the

1265
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:26,339
point of time at which your car is

1266
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:28,380
somewhat predictable to you and when it

1267
00:52:26,339 --> 00:52:29,579
comes to control and it's up to you to

1268
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:31,260
take it to the next level with your

1269
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:34,260
drifting skills I've seen a lot of

1270
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:36,420
videos of if some of you guys are doing

1271
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:39,240
donuts donuts will get you nowhere

1272
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:42,059
always try to drift around fixed objects

1273
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:44,240
start with a DOT or a cup anything

1274
00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:45,480
that's fixed to the ground and try

1275
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:48,000
[Music]

1276
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:50,099
spin around it while maintaining a

1277
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,020
constant distance from it this is number

1278
00:52:50,099 --> 00:52:55,020
one then go to two dots then three dots

1279
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:56,760
then after that create small a track the

1280
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:58,859
point here is not just to slide the

1281
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:00,960
point here is to be predictable with

1282
00:52:58,859 --> 00:53:03,240
your sliding action to be in total

1283
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:05,160
control of your motion and I've seen a

1284
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:08,300
lot of guys also um

1285
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:11,160
paying or paying more attention to the

1286
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:13,020
aesthetic of their car like the body the

1287
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:16,380
wheels and everything

1288
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:18,300
if your car does not ride well and slide

1289
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:21,359
well does it really matter how it looks

1290
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:23,880
this is for my perspective I've been in

1291
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:27,359
this hobby for almost now a year and the

1292
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:30,480
most expensive body I have is this one

1293
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:32,339
forty dollars all other bodies I have

1294
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:35,579
either twenty twenty five dollars

1295
00:53:32,339 --> 00:53:37,740
because most of my time I spend it on

1296
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:40,260
tuning and building and getting my my

1297
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:43,619
drifting skills and my 20 skills to be

1298
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:45,720
right so let's uh put what what all what

1299
00:53:43,619 --> 00:53:48,180
we talked about into practice I chose to

1300
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:50,160
go for the xrx for the demonstration

1301
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:52,260
because I noticed most of you guys are

1302
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,760
picking this chassis up these days and

1303
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:56,760
understandably why it's one of my

1304
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:59,640
favorites so what I have here is the

1305
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:02,819
cheapest form of the xrx the full

1306
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:04,920
plastic form except for three parts uh I

1307
00:54:02,819 --> 00:54:07,859
have the adjustable wheelbase

1308
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:10,260
plates and I have the alloy shop towers

1309
00:54:07,859 --> 00:54:11,960
and I have the rear toe block these are

1310
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:14,460
the three things that I purchased extra

1311
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:17,760
other than that it's the cheapest one

1312
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:20,040
the base the base model so regarding the

1313
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:23,579
adjustable wheelbase I remove I run this

1314
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:25,920
usually at 102 millimeter with my Die

1315
00:54:23,579 --> 00:54:28,559
Cast body but for this demonstration I

1316
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:30,240
shrunked it down back to 94 millimeters

1317
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:32,460
so if you if you don't have adjustable

1318
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:34,800
wheelbase this is the dimension that

1319
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:37,980
you're gonna get the same with our

1320
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:40,380
wheelbase of this same shape of this the

1321
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:43,380
second thing is the shock towers and

1322
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:46,619
this is um this is an Integrity upgrade

1323
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:48,720
rather than performance upgrade the only

1324
00:54:46,619 --> 00:54:51,240
thing that I hate about the xrx is that

1325
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:53,400
shop Tower which is even though it's

1326
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:55,859
carbon fiber it's very thin when you

1327
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:58,020
scroll in your rear mounting screws

1328
00:54:55,859 --> 00:55:00,900
you'll immediately notice that the tower

1329
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:03,000
itself will bow in and with time it can

1330
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:04,619
crack it did not crack on me but I did

1331
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,380
not wait for it I immediately went it

1332
00:55:04,619 --> 00:55:09,599
for the alloy shock Towers the other

1333
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:12,599
thing is when you install the alloy

1334
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:15,480
shock Towers it's considerably thicker

1335
00:55:12,599 --> 00:55:16,680
than the standard so what happened is if

1336
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:19,020
you run your

1337
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:21,540
shocks in the correct position meaning

1338
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:23,760
the the tension ring up top it will

1339
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:25,980
catch against the shock itself and it

1340
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:27,780
will Jam the smooth it will Jam the the

1341
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:30,300
arm itself it will not the shock will

1342
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:32,940
not function smoothly so if you have

1343
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:35,280
this you have to reverse

1344
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:38,220
your shocks keep the Rings the tension

1345
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:40,200
rings at the bottom rear and front so

1346
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:42,720
this is the second thing I did the the

1347
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:45,300
other thing I did is usually I run this

1348
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:47,760
car wide wider than this I undo the the

1349
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:51,119
links the upper and lower links to get a

1350
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:53,339
wider width track width but I went for

1351
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:56,640
stock this is the stock as the manual

1352
00:55:53,339 --> 00:55:59,220
says and I run curved steering links

1353
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:00,599
again I went with stock steering legs

1354
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:03,119
straight steering mix just to

1355
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:05,339
demonstrate what your car what would

1356
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:06,780
your car your car will perform as

1357
00:56:05,339 --> 00:56:08,640
compared to this if you if you follow

1358
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:12,540
the same instructions uh the other

1359
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:15,180
things other than that nothing special

1360
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:18,780
the top block I have is 2.5

1361
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:21,839
yes the shock itself there is shocks

1362
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:23,940
for the standard xrx the shocks that

1363
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:26,280
come with it the rear one is very stiff

1364
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:29,940
for me so I went for this shocks which I

1365
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:32,640
stole from one of my son's toy cars and

1366
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:33,839
it's a little bit it's not soft it's

1367
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:36,300
medium

1368
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:39,059
if you want to to buy it I think it's

1369
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:40,800
it's very comparable to the medium shots

1370
00:56:39,059 --> 00:56:42,240
that you get with the

1371
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:45,540
with the DK

1372
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:49,559
electronic wise I'm running the the

1373
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:53,280
standard a11 CLS servo

1374
00:56:49,559 --> 00:56:55,559
I'm running the V2 gyro

1375
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:59,460
surpass hobby which is very cheap 12 or

1376
00:56:55,559 --> 00:57:01,680
14 dollars I'm not sure 6000 KV and I

1377
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:04,500
geared up more this time this is 26

1378
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:09,119
tooth Pena I have the standard atomic

1379
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:11,400
sensorless ESC uh adjusted the punch

1380
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:14,960
value is adjusted to one as we talked

1381
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:14,960
about and other than that

1382
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:20,359
oh right height

1383
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:20,359
my right height

1384
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:23,819
back

1385
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:27,119
two millimeter

1386
00:57:23,819 --> 00:57:29,640
front 2.5 millimeter so my chassis is

1387
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:33,740
leaning backwards I'm not sure if I can

1388
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:33,740
if you can grab this camera

1389
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:39,240
and I'm going for a high most romantic

1390
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:42,140
position if you are a beginner don't

1391
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:44,400
install your Mount your motor down below

1392
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:47,579
the reason for that because I want to

1393
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:51,000
test this combination of

1394
00:57:47,579 --> 00:57:53,880
throttle curve and uh gearing up and

1395
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:55,920
punch zero Punch or low punch to see if

1396
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:58,079
I can control the car like this the

1397
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:00,540
higher motor mount position requires

1398
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:03,000
more throttle control it's more suitable

1399
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:05,220
if you have a sensored system and it's

1400
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,440
more suitable if you have any previous

1401
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:09,599
experience when it comes to Drifting as

1402
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:13,500
general regarding wheel alignment I'm

1403
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:15,119
running rear zero camber

1404
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:18,119
front

1405
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:20,280
three degrees camber I'm running almost

1406
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:21,960
parallel steering you can see it here

1407
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:24,359
this it looks like a towel it's not too

1408
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:27,420
hot because when you squat the car

1409
00:58:24,359 --> 00:58:30,839
it will almost end up

1410
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:34,440
a sparrow steering or pair Ackerman and

1411
00:58:30,839 --> 00:58:36,540
other than that my Caster is Max all my

1412
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:39,240
spacers are up front here if you can see

1413
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:42,859
so the arms are pushed all the way back

1414
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:42,859
and we'll see how that performs

1415
00:58:43,790 --> 00:58:51,650

1424
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:42,900
there you go guys that's almost almost

1425
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:45,540
all I know regarding this Hobby I

1426
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:47,940
remember when I started up I used to bug

1427
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:49,920
Beaver all the time with questions

1428
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:52,020
all the time and he was kind enough to

1429
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:54,240
answer all of them and I'm trying to do

1430
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:57,660
the same here share whatever I know with

1431
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:59,940
you if you are a beginner just ask man

1432
01:00:57,660 --> 01:01:02,940
there's no shame in that there are no

1433
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:05,220
such thing as stupid questions asked and

1434
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:08,000
we will try as a group we will try to

1435
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:11,099
answer you to our best ability

1436
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:13,920
sometimes I I come across

1437
01:01:11,099 --> 01:01:16,500
a threat that I don't react to the

1438
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:17,700
reason for that mostly is either um I

1439
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:20,339
don't know the answer to that question

1440
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:23,099
or I don't own that chassis so I don't

1441
01:01:20,339 --> 01:01:25,799
want to speak about something that I've

1442
01:01:23,099 --> 01:01:28,079
never tried or or drifted I don't want

1443
01:01:25,799 --> 01:01:29,880
to spread any false information but if

1444
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:32,700
if the question regarding something I

1445
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:36,000
own or something I tried I I usually

1446
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:38,760
answer it immediately if you are an old

1447
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:41,119
Drifter regarding all Drifters guys stop

1448
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:43,380
being [ __ ] toward newcomers

1449
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:45,020
share the information guys share the

1450
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:46,680
share the love

1451
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:48,599
this

1452
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:50,460
is not something that you can prove your

1453
01:01:48,599 --> 01:01:52,640
manhood over

1454
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:56,280
stop killing the hobby help one another

1455
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:58,799
and I hope this video helps you with

1456
01:01:56,280 --> 01:02:02,000
your build in some shape or form and

1457
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:02,000
with that being said Peace
